<h3>Aims</h3>
<p>
	This assignment aims to give you practice in
</p>
<ul>
	<li> implementing Python scripts to extract and display data from a database
	<li> [optionally (but recommended)] implementing SQL views and PLpgSQL functions to support the scripts
	<li> [optionally (but recommended)] implementing a collection of Python functions to support the scripts
</ul>
<p>
	You could complete this assignment with minimal use of SQL.
	<br />
	However, it is highly recommended that you use SQL for its intended purpose:
	<br />
	Use SQL queries, views, and functions to filter and manipulate the data
	<br />
	Use Python to format and display the data
</p>

<p>
	The goal is to build some useful data access operations on the Pokemon database.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
    Pokemon is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokemon Company,
    founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.
    <br />
    The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996,
    and is centered around fictional creatures called "Pokemon".
    <br />
    <small>~ Wikipedia</small>
</p>
<p>
    Specifically for this assignment, we are interested in the Pokemon video games.
</p>
<blockquote >
    The Pokemon games are basically just databases
    with each game updating the User Interface.
    <br />
    <small>~ Dylan Brotherston (describing this assignment to JAS), 2020</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Pokemon have a lot of information associated with them.
    <br />
    And many relationships between different game elements.
</p>
<p>
    Websites like
    <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page">Bulbapedia</a>,
    <a href="https://pokemondb.net/">The Pokemon Database</a>,
    <a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokemon/">Serebii</a>,
    and even the official
    <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex">Pokemon website</a>
    have searchable databases of Pokemon, moves, abilities, locations, and much more.
</p>
<p>
    For this assignment (with a lot of python scripts and web scraping),
    we have set up a PostgreSQL database
    containing information about (almost) all 1008 Pokemon from all 9 generations,
    as well as all moves, abilities, and locations.
</p>
<p>
	The Pokemon database for this assignment is not a database for a
	specific Pokemon game. Rather, it contains a large amount of
	general information about Pokemon capabilities.
	If this database was combined with tables to hold the game state,
	then it would form a basis to run a specific Pokemon game.
	There is much more detail on what is in the database and what all the
	tables represent, in the "Database Design" page.
</p>

<h3>Setting Up</h3>

<p>
  In addition to the database dump file, available on the <a href="data.html"><tt>SQL Data</tt></a> page,
  you are also provided a template Python files, and Python and SQL helper files.
</p>

<p>
	The "template files" aim to save you some time in writing Python code.
	E.g. they do handle the command-line arguments and let you focus on the
	database interaction.
</p>
<p>
	The <tt>helpers.py</tt> and <tt>helpers.sql</tt> files are provided in case you want to define
	Python functions or PLpgSQL functions that might be useful in several of your scripts.
	You are not required to use them (i.e. you can leave them unchanged).
</p>
<p>
	The template files are available in a single
	<a href="files/files.zip" download="ass2.files.zip">ZIP</a>
	or
	<a href="files/files.tar" download="ass2.files.tar">TAR</a>
	file, which contains the following:
</p>

<p>
	or copy them to your CSE account with the following command:
</p>
<pre>$ cp /web/cs3311/current/assignments/ass2/files/* .</pre>

<br>
<h3>Style</h3>
<p>
	2 marks for the assignment will be based on the style of your code.
</p>
<p>
	Similarly to the previous assignment, the main things to look out for are:
	<ul>
		<li> readability </li>
		<li> consistency </li>
	</ul>
	above matching any specific style guide.
</p>
<p>
	But in saying that, Python has an official style guide <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a>
	that we recommend you follow (again not explicitly required, just a suggestion).
</p>
<p>
	Python also has tools like
	<a href="https://pypi.org/project/black/">black</a>,
	<a href="https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/">autopep8</a>,
	<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pylint/">pylint</a>,
	that can identify and fix many of the common style issues.
</p>

<h3>Script Design</h3>
<p>
	Python scripts should be designed with the following principles in mind:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Use SQL to extract data in a form that is easy to process
	<li> Use Python to take the data, format it, and produce output
</ul>
<p>
	In other words Data queries, filtering, grouping, sorting, etc should be done in SQL
	<br />
	while data formatting, conditions, error checking, etc should be done in Python.
</p>
<p>
	You <b>should not</b> be pulling 1000s of rows from the database and then filtering them in Python
	<br />
	or matching foreign key values between separate queries in Python.
</p>
<p>
	Such practices typically lead to inefficient code.
	<br />
	Python scripts that take longer than 2 seconds to execute will be penalised.
	<br />
	Python scripts that take longer than 5 will be killed and receive a mark of 0.
	<br />
	Your Python scripts shouldn't need more than half a second in the worst case.
</p>
<p>
	And, of course, you should follow the normal abstraction practices
	you have learned in earlier programming courses, e.g. repeated
	sections of code should be placed in functions, etc.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>

<!--
	====================================================================================================
-->

<h4 align="center">Q1 <small>(1 Marks)</small></h4>
<p>
    In the file <tt>q1.py</tt> write a script that takes 0 command line arguments,
    and prints information about the number of distinct egg groups and the number of distinct Pokemon for each game.
</p>
<p>
    Display each game on a separate line, using the following formatting:
</p>
<pre>
f"{GameName:&lt;17} {#EggGroup:&lt;9} {#Pokemon:&lt;8}"
</pre>
<p>
    Add a heading at the start of the output in the following formatting:
</p>
<pre>
GameName          #EggGroup #Pokemon
</pre>
<p>
    The output should be ordered by GameName in lexicographical order.
</p>

<!--
	====================================================================================================
-->

<h4 align="center">Q2 <small>(2 Marks)</small></h4>
<p>
    In the file <tt>q2.py</tt>, write a script that takes 0 command-line arguments,
    and prints information about the number of distinct moves of each type and the number of distinct Pokemon  
    (whose first type matches the given type) that can learn more than 10 moves of that type.
</p>
<p>
    Display each type on a separate line, using the following formatting:
</p>
<pre>
f"{TypeName:&lt;12} {#Moves:&lt;8} {#Pokemon:&lt;8}"
</pre>
<p>
    Add a heading at the start of the output in the following formatting:
</p>
<pre>
TypeName     #Moves   #Pokemon
</pre>
<p>
    The output should be ordered by TypeName in lexicographical order.
</p>

<!--
	====================================================================================================
-->

<h4 align="center">Q3 <small>(2 Marks)</small></h4>
<p>
    In the file <tt>q3.py</tt>, write a script that takes 1 command-line argument:  
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The name of a Pokemon <span style="color:brown">(exact match, case-sensitive).</span> </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The script should identify all distinct moves that the given Pokemon can learn by level-up in at least 30 different games.
	For each move, print the move name, the number of games in which the move is learnable, and the average level at which the move is learned.
</p>
<p>
    Your output should include the following:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Move Name</li>
	<li>Number of Games</li>
	<li>Average Learnt Level (rounded to the nearest integer)</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Display each move on a separate line, using the following formatting:
</p>
<pre>
f"{MoveName:&lt;16} {#Games:&lt;6} {AvgLearntLevel:&lt;16}"
</pre>
<p>
    Add a heading at the start of the output in the following formatting:
</p>
<pre>
MoveName         #Games #AvgLearntLevel
</pre>
<p>
	The output should be ordered by MoveName in lexicographical order.
</p>
<p>
	If the input Pokemon does not exist, print an error message as shown on the examples page, and exit.
</p>
<p style="color:brown">
	You can assume that levels are between 1-100 inclusive, and that the level requirement IDs are sequential, but you can not assume that the requirement id
	will always correspond to the level number.
</p>
<!--
	====================================================================================================

<h4 align="center">Q4 <small>(3 Marks)</small></h4>

<p>
    In the file <tt>q4.py</tt>, write a script that takes 1 command-line argument:  
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The string that the Pokemon name needs to contain.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The script should output the <strong>full evolution chain</strong> for each Pokemon whose name contains the input string.
</p>
<p>
    The evolution chain is defined as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Pre-Evolutions:</b> All Pokemon that can reach the given Pokemon through one or more evolutionary steps.</li>
    <li><b>Post-Evolutions:</b> All Pokemon reachable by evolving the given Pokemon (or any intermediate evolution) through one or more evolution steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    For each queried Pokemon (i.e., the Pokemon whose name contains the input string), the output format should be as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first line should display the queried Pokemon's name, followed by a colon and the text "The full evolution chain:".</li>
    <li>Then, for each branch of the evolution chain, display the base (leaf) Pokemon (i.e. those with no pre-evolutions) 's <span style="color:red">name.</span></li>
    <li>For each branch of the evolution chain:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Print name of the base Pokemon (i.e., the one wit no pre-evolution).</li>
		<li>For each evolution step in the chain, print an indented line using a fixed symbol (a '+' per depth level) to indicate hierarchy. The format should be:
			<pre style="color:brown">&lt;Indentation&gt; For "&lt;PostEvolutionName&gt;", The evolution requirement is [&lt;Req1&gt;] AND [&lt;Req2&gt;] AND ...</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Each evolution step may have multiple evolution requirements. These requirements should be aggregated from the requirements table.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If an evolution requirement is inverted (i.e., <tt>inverted = true</tt>), prefix its assertion with "Not ".</li>
			<li>The aggregated requirements for a single evolution step should be displayed as a list connected by " AND "<span style="color:red">, and ordered by requirement ID</span>.</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
</ul>
<p>
    The output should be ordered by Pokemon name in lexicographical order. When multiple candidates (base Pokemon or post-evolved Pokemon) exist, also follow lexicographical order.
</p>
<p>
    <span style="color:red">
	If a Pokemon to Pokemon evolution has multiple evolution methods, print all methods
	and order the evolution methods by evolution ID.
	</span>
	</p>
<p>
    If there is no Pokemon name containing the input string, print an error message as shown on the examples page, and exit.
</p>

<!--
	====================================================================================================
-->

<h4 align="center">Q5 <small>(5 Marks)</small></h4>
<p>
    In the file <tt>q5.py</tt> write a script that takes 2 command line arguments.
</p>
<p>
	For each basic Pokemon (Pokemon that can not be evolved into) that has at least one evolution, print out their final stage evolution(s) (Pokemon
	that can not evolve into another), if all intermediate evolutions fulfill the conditions set out by the command-line arguments:
</p>
	 
<ol>
    <li>
		Requirements List: A semicolon-separated list of evolution requirements (e.g., "High Friendship;Level: 100;Hold Item: Ghost Memory"). All requirements of an evolution chain
		have to be a subset of this list for the chain be included in your result.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			For any requirement containing a numeric value (e.g., "Level: 100"), 
			only consider those records from the requirements table where the numeric value extracted from the
			assertion is <strong>less than or equal to</strong> the provided value. You can assume a requirement
			can have only one number maximum, but you can not assume that the requirement in this list is directly
			in the database. e.g. 'Critical Hit: 100X', whilst not in the database, will fulfill 'Critical Hit: 3X'.
		</li>
		<li>
			Inverted requirements will start with 'Not ', e.g. 'Not Region: Hisui'.
		</li>
		<li>
			Requirements should be matched in a case-insensitive manner.
		</li>
		<li><span style="color: brown">If this list is empty, there are no type restrictions at all.</span></li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		Type List: A semicolon-separated list of Pokemon types (e.g., "Water;^Electric")
		<ul>
			<li>
				Types without a leading caret (^) indicate possible types that must be present in all stages of evolution (either as the Pokemon's first or second type).
				So if there are two or more types, such as "Water;Fire", it will match evolution chains where all Pokemon involved are Water type, or all Pokemon involved are Fire type.
			</li>
			<li>
				Types prefixed with ^ indicate types that must not be present in any stage of the evolution process.
			</li>
			<li>
				Requirements should be matched in a case-insensitive manner.
			</li>	
		</ul>
</ol>
	<ul>
		<li>
			For example, if the Requirement List is "High Friendship;Level: 100;Hold Item: Ghost Memory", a Pokemon evolution chain that requires a level of 40 and "High Friendship" is valid, as long as the remaining requirements are a subset of the provided argument list.
		</li>
		<li>
			For example, if the Type List is "Water;Fire;^Electric", an evolution chain the type "Water" or "Fire" is valid, as long as if none of the Pokemon in the chain has the type "Electric". A Pokemon with the type "Electric" would not be valid, even if it also has "Water" or "Fire".
		</li>
    
	</ul>
    
	
	<p>
		The output should be printed in the following format, ordered by evolution depth, then final stage Pokemon, then basic Pokemon and Pokemon name: 
	</p>
	<pre> You can get the final <span style="color:red">p</span>okemon &lt;final_pokemon_name&gt; by evolving &lt;basic_pokemon_name&gt; &lt;n&gt; times!</pre>
	<p>
		In this format, &lt;n&gt; represents the number of evolution steps (depth), and &lt;final_pokemon_name&gt; is the name of the Pokemon at the end of the evolution chain. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If there is no valid evolution chain, print an error message as shown on the examples page, and exit.
	</p> 

	<p>
		For Pokemon evolutions with multiple evolution methods, deal with each evolution method's requirements separately, but only print the (basic Pokemon, final Pokemon) pair once.
	</p>
